      <h2> Roe v. Wade</h2>
    <p>
     As the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the states may now decide whether abortion is legal or not. Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wyoming have trigger laws set to take effect in the event that Roe was overturned. 
    </p>
    <p>
      With trigger laws, pre-Roe bans, 6-8 week bans, or near total bans, 26 states are either certain or likely to ban abortion. These states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

      <h2>Fact Checking</h2>
    <p>Before we go into the impact of this ruling, let's clear up some misconceptions. For instance, abortion bans don’t actually lower abortion rates. In fact in the US, laws that restict abortion don’t have any affect on abortion rates. This study found that between 2008 and 2011, despite the fact that many states had reduced access to abortion, there was no corralation between these restriction and the abortion rates. Similar results are found in this research, which analyzed the aftermath in 23 states after they passed laws restricting abortion access. </p>
    
<p>Interestingly, on a global scope, countries that ban or restrict abortion tend to have higher abortion rates. For instance, in Brazil, where abortion is esentially illegal, has abortion rates 2 or 3 times that of the US. This seems to be a pattern when you compare countries with abortion bans and restriction to ones without. Essentially, abortion bans increase abortion rates.</p> 

<p>This is because that abortion bans don’t prevent people from having an abortion- they prevent people from having a safe abortion. </p>
